This project is about a brief detailed model of autonomous vehicle and communication using Bluetooth module.
This project uses 
1.HC-05 BT module 
2.Ultrasonic Sensor 
3.Arduino UNO
4.A power supply source(a small power bank 3000maH) 
5.2 leds
6.2 wheel car kit consisting of 2 DC motors, wheels
7. L293D Motor Driver
8. Breadborad is needed for making connections easily

This project uses Arduino IDE and the DC motors are connected to the motor driver, all the components are connected to the microcontroller Arduino UNO.The Arduino IDE in turn is connected to a temporary power source that can be a small power bank or batteries.
